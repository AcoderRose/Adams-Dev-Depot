# Adams-Dev-Depot

## Description

### This project demonstrates my freshly acquired coding skills. As I move forward in my career, I aim to regularly update this portfolio to showcase my developing abilities and newly completed projects.

## My portfolio is made to be a flexible and user-friendly website. It is essentially my coding journey and all the cool stuff I've learned up to now.

- I utilized flexbox to create tidy and adaptable layouts, ensuring everything stays well-organized and visually appealing.

- I incorporated media queries to ensure seamless functionality of the site across a range of devices, spanning from smartphones to desktop computers.

- I utilized CSS variables to effortlessly maintain the site's consistent style throughout.

### As my skills progress, this portfolio will keep on expanding!
